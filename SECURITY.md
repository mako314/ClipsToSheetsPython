# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I incorporated [Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to turn this application into a one file exe. That being said, it's currently not hosted anywhere so anybody claiming to be me trying to give you the exe is LYING.

My communcations will onyl ever come through:
bispo.swe@gmail.com
discord: makocodesnow

please, if there are any security concerns reach out to me.

You are more than welcome to recreate the app (exe) and distribute similar to how I did to Pyinstaller.
