## Contributing

Originally I had intended for this project to remain private. However I've taken a turn in the world of building in public. That being said, this will remain free, forever. That being said, I wont't have as much time to maintain this as I'd like. I'm truly passionate about full stack development but I learned a tremendous amount in the development of this app. 

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
